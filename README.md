# GoSH - (On the) Go Shell

Gosh is a reimplementation of mosh, but not protocol compatible with it. It
embodies the same ideas - secure UDP connection with IP roaming within the
session but does not implement every thing mosh did. For now, it focuses on the
roaming abilities without the local echo feature.
